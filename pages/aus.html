                    As you may have learned in the homepage, AUs are fanmade reinterpretations or variations on Undertale.
                    <br>In this webpage, we will go more indepth on some of the most popular AUs. Describing what they're about and what's changed from the original game.
                    <br><br><strong>Some important things you may need to know:</strong>
                    <br>Some of these AUs differ drasticly from the original game in both story, and personalities of the different characters.
                    <br>That being said, it is reccommended to have played the original game before checking out these AUs for yourself. 
                    While this website does do it's best to be spoiler-free, you will probably recieve spoilers if you go check out these AUs for yourself.
                    <br>Sans is the most popular character in the fandom, so expect to see alot of variants of him here.
                    <br>This page only coveres a few of the most popular AUs so check out the links in the footer if you want to see more.
                    <br>There is an important concept covered later in this page, <strong>Out!Codes</strong>. Please be sure to read that section if you plan to skip over some parts.

                                Underswap is an AU similar to undertale, but with the key difference of almost every character having their role and personality "swapped" from the original game.
                                <br>A good example of this is Sans now becoming more energetic, wheras Papyrus becomes more laid back and chill, as seen on the image on the left.
                                <br>Despite this, the characters do have their own personality quriks.
                                <br><br>This AU was orinally created by Popcorn Pr1nce, but is now <strong>Community Owned</strong>, meaning that the community and fans of this AU make the content for it. There isn't an "official version" of this AU.
                                <br><br>Not to mention, it was one of the first AUs ever made and also one of the most popular, with lots of content coming from this AU.
                                <br><br>Some of the swapped characters in this AU include:

                        Underfell is a community owned AU that's meant to play as a much darker spin on the original Undertale.
                        <br><br>After getting sealed underground, Asgore became vengeful, developing a deep, permanent hatred for humanity. 
                        <br>His hatred for humanity directly affected the underground, making everyone more miserable and fearful in the underground. 
                        <br>Miserable due to the horrible and hostile living environments, and fearful because one wrong move could mean death by the hands of their king.
                        <br><br>This has caused the inhabitants of the Underground to become alot less happy and even malicious to an extent.
                        <br>In this AU, you still play as the same main protagonist and luckily you still have your good friend Flowey to help you along this journey!
                        <br><br>In the image above, you can see how each of the main characters have changed, each becoming alot darker (and edgier) than their original counterpart.

                            Outertale is an AU very similar to that of Undertale, with one key difference.
                            <br>That key difference being that instead of the monsters being sealed underground, they were banished to another star system in deep space.
                            <br>You play as a child who's been sent to said star system and must find a way out.
                            <br><br>This is one of the few AUs that actually has a full playable fangame tied to it. That being <a href="https://gamejolt.com/games/outertale/643082">Project Spacetime</a>

                            <br><br>For example, Papyrus takes the role of Toriel, Sans takes the role of Asgore, Undyne takes the role of Mettaton, and more!
                            <br><br>The most popular character in this AU the person who takes the role of Sans. However we won't talk about them in this article as it counts as a spoiler for Undertale.

                        Out!Codes, in short, are Fanamde Characters that don't belong to any specific AU.
                        <br>Instead, they're often seen travelling across the Multiverse to different AUs in Fanmade Content.
                        <br>Out!Codes are a cool concept and tool often used by the fandom to have crossovers between AUs.
                        <br>These characters are often protrayed to be very powerful which also explains their ability to traverse Uniiverses.
                        <br><br>Good examples of Out!Codes are Ink Sans and Error Sans who are explained below.

                            <br>He is often seen wielding a giant paintbrush on him that channels his power which he uses as his main weapon.
                            <br>His main place of residence is The Doodlesphere which also allows him to traverse the Multiverse.

                            <br>He usually resides in the Antivoid which acts kind of like Ink's Doodlesphere.
                            <br>His main weapon is strings that he uses to catch his opponent's SOUL.
